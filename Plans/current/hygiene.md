## Read this first — hygiene law

**Every pass on this plan is a deletion pass dressed as cleanup.** Pick one dialect, one write site, one factory per duplicated concept. Net **negative** line count. If the diff adds layers, getters, barrels, or copy-paste with a new filename — **stop**.

**Tests migrate with the dialect — same PR, no shims.** When a handle or API is deleted (`blackboard`, `decisionSnapshot`, `ElevationCamera`, `getPropAsset`), **update every test in that PR**. Never leave production aliases, adapter wrappers, or dual-shape returns so old test imports keep working. Deprecated dialect in `Libraries/` because `tests/` still says `blackboard` is the same bug as keeping `px/py/zoom` in draw code because tests never got updated. If a test only asserts obsolete shape, **delete or rewrite the test** — do not preserve the obsolete shape in prod. See [`stupid.md`](stupid.md#tests-follow-the-dialect--never-ship-compatibility-shims).

This work spans AI, navigation, and game adapters. The spoke docs below are **binding**. Re-read the relevant rows before opening a PR.

### What “passthrough” means here

A function, object, param, or layer that exists **only to forward data the caller already has**. In this plan that includes:

- Copying distance/target fields perception → memory → blackboard → scorer (Tier 1b — **dead**, see [`fsmroadmap.md`](fsmroadmap.md))
- Threading `reachSteps` through memory enrich instead of computing once at intent adapter
- `buildNavReachHorizon()` → `{ stepsTo }` closure every agent
- `buildSnakeDecisionContext` / `buildFleeDecisionContext` wrappers that add no logic
- Threading the same config through 3 functions when `getSnakeGameConfig()` at the read site works
- Factory that returns one closure and nothing else
- Second blackboard layer (`visible.*Dist`, `remembered.*Dist`, `known.*Dist`) for the same fact
- **`blackboard` + `decisionSnapshot` as sibling bags** (H2 — viewport/`ElevationCamera` class bug)
- **`facts.visible` / `facts.remembered` copies of `visibleWorld` / memory** — merge once into `known`
- **`readThreatState(world)` reading `blackboard ?? decisionSnapshot`** — one handle only
- **One-export micro-files** whose only caller is another module in the same PR (inline or merge — see Part 1 review in [`fsmroadmap.md`](fsmroadmap.md))

**Fix pattern:** compute at the boundary · pass scalars/records once · delete the copies.
