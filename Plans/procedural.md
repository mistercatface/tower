# Procedural & level generation — research tree

Progress tracker for world/level generation: seeded RNG → cavern carving → room-graph authoring → bake-to-geometry → corridors → special rooms → puzzles → placement → theming → world scale → reproducibility → layout generators. Read top-to-bottom like a tech tree. Percentages are **honest engineering completion** (generates real, used geometry) — not "a helper exists."

**Legend:** ✅ shipped · 🟡 partial · ⬜ not started · 🔗 owned by another doc (referenced here) · 🔜 planned

**Overall engine maturity:** ~**40%** of a full procedural level-generation stack. The honest one-liner: **strong procedural *resolution*, weak procedural *authorship***. The engine is excellent at turning authored-or-seeded *inputs* into real grid geometry (cellular-automata caverns, corridor A* bake, locked-room mechanisms, one puzzle template) — but it does **not** yet *decide* a level layout from a seed. Room placement is manual; there's no dungeon-graph generator, no WFC/BSP, and no unified world seed. The bones (seeded RNG, stamp/bake pipeline, expandable grid) are solid; the brain that arranges rooms is missing.

---

## Scope & ownership (read this first — it's why the docs stop overlapping)

These roadmaps bleed into each other. The rule: **each doc owns one layer; shared concerns are `🔗` references, not duplicated content.** This doc owns **generation of gameplay geometry and content layout**. It explicitly does **not** own:

| Concern | Owner | Why it's not here |
|---|---|---|
| The corridor **solver** (cardinal A*, attachment search) | 🔗 `pathfinding.md` Tier 9 | It's a pathfinder; this doc only *calls* it to bake corridors |
| Whether a puzzle is **winnable** / **difficulty grading** | 🔗 `AI.md` Tier 10 | Solvability is decision analysis, not stamping |
| **Drawing** generated geometry (walls, floor textures) | 🔗 `rendering.md` Tiers 6, 8 | Wall atlas + surface texturing are render pipelines |
| Procedural **surface textures** (Perlin/Voronoi in `Libraries/Procedural/`) | 🔗 `rendering.md` Tier 8 | Confusingly named — that's *texture synthesis*, a visual concern |
| The **grid** representation (`canStep`, nav epoch) | 🔗 `pathfinding.md` Tier 0 | Generation *writes to* the grid; it doesn't define it |

> **Naming trap:** `Libraries/Procedural/` (Perlin noise, Voronoi motifs) is for **surface textures**, *not* level geometry. "Procedural" in *this* doc means **world/level geometry & content** — caverns, rooms, corridors, puzzles, placement. Don't conflate them.

So the boundary in one sentence: **this doc carves and arranges space; rendering draws it, pathfinding routes through it, AI judges it.**

## Where this sits vs procgen-heavy engines

The yardstick is the roguelike/procgen canon: NetHack/DCSS room-and-corridor dungeons, **Spelunky** room templates, Diablo random dungeons, **WFC** games (Townscaper, Bad North), No Man's Sky chunk streaming.

| Capability | This engine | Procgen canon (Spelunky · DCSS · WFC games · NMS) |
|---|---|---|
| Seeded RNG | ✅ LCG, reproducible per-system | Seeded master RNG, fully reproducible runs |
| Cave carving | ✅ cellular automata | CA / drunkard's walk / noise |
| Room representation | ✅ grid-rect node graph | Templates, BSP leaves, tiles |
| Room **layout generation** | ⬜ manual placement | BSP / packing / graph grammar / MST |
| Corridor routing | ✅ A* bake (🔗 solver) | Tunneling / L-corridors / A* |
| Templates / set-pieces | 🟡 one (belt-crate) | Large template libraries (Spelunky rooms) |
| Constraint-based layout | ⬜ none | WFC / CSP / answer-set |
| Biomes / theming | 🟡 authored per-region | Biome maps, climate fields |
| World scale | 🟡 single expandable region | Chunk-streamed / infinite |
| End-to-end seed → level | ⬜ no | Yes (whole run from one seed) |

**Takeaway:** the *primitives* (seeded carving, bake-to-geometry, template stamping) are real and at parity; the *arranger* (a generator that lays out a whole level from a seed) is the headline gap.

## Fundamentals checklist — textbook procgen coverage

A different lens from the feature tiers below: which **CS procgen building blocks** exist in the codebase? `[x]` = implemented and used · `[~]` = present as a narrow/special case · `[ ]` = absent. (Remember the **naming trap**: `Libraries/Procedural/` noise is for *textures* — 🔗 `rendering.md`, not counted here as *geometry*.)

### Randomness & noise
- [x] **Seeded PRNG (LCG)** — `seededRandom.js`, `SeededRng.js`; `withSeededRandom(seed, fn)` scopes `Math.random`.
- [~] **Perlin / Voronoi noise** — exists but for **surface textures only** (🔗 `rendering.md` Tier 8), not level geometry.
- [ ] **Simplex / OpenSimplex**, [ ] **blue noise / Poisson-disk sampling** — absent; no spatial-distribution sampler for scatter/placement.

### Space carving & layout
- [x] **Cellular automata** — Moore-neighborhood majority smoothing (`cellularAutomata.js`, threshold ≥5) → caverns.
- [ ] **Drunkard's walk / random-walk tunneling** — absent (CA only).
- [ ] **BSP partitioning** — absent; the headline layout gap.
- [ ] **Wave Function Collapse (constraint propagation)** — absent.
- [ ] **Graph grammar / L-system** — absent.

### Graphs & connectivity
- [x] **Room-graph model** — rect nodes + directed links (`RoomGraph/`).
- [x] **Distance transform (BFS)** — shared with HPA region seeding (🔗 `pathfinding.md`).
- [~] **Voronoi partition** — used for nav regions + texture motifs, not room layout.
- [ ] **Minimum spanning tree (MST)** / [ ] **Delaunay triangulation** — absent; the natural "connect rooms sensibly" primitives for a layout generator.

### Search & solving (for the bake)
- [x] **Cardinal A\* corridor routing** — delegated to the pathfinder (🔗 `pathfinding.md` Tier 9); this doc only *calls* it.
- [x] **Backtracking attachment search** — room/door placement during bake.
- [ ] **Constraint satisfaction (solvability)** — 🔗 `AI.md` Tier 10; geometric stamping only, no validator.

### Reproducibility
- [x] **Per-subsystem seeding** — map seed, per-link corridor seed.
- [ ] **Unified root seed → derived sub-seeds** — absent; top recommended unlock (one seed ⇒ whole reproducible level).

> **Read:** the **carve (CA) → author graph → bake-to-geometry → route corridors (A\*)** pipeline is real and used — strong procedural **resolution**. The empty boxes cluster in one place: **layout *authorship*** (BSP/MST/WFC/graph-grammar) and a **unified seed**. That's the difference between "renders an authored level" and "invents a level from a number."

## What's strong vs what's missing

**Strong — procedural *resolution*:**
1. **Cellular-automata caverns**, seeded and shape-masked, stamping real voxel + rail-edge walls.
2. **Bake pipeline**: an authored room graph becomes correct grid geometry — rooms, openings, perimeter rails, corridors (A*), belts, locked-room mechanisms.
3. **Template stamping** with probe-before-commit retry (the belt-crate puzzle proves the pattern works).

**Missing — procedural *authorship*:**
1. **No layout generator (Tier 11).** Rooms are placed by hand; nothing emits a room graph from a seed. This is *the* gap.
2. **No unified seed (Tier 10).** Can't reproduce a whole level from one number.
3. **One puzzle template, uniform placement, no biome map.** Breadth gaps once a generator exists.

## The keystone: a room-graph generator that feeds the existing bake

The highest-leverage move is **Tier 11 rung 1** — a simple generator (random rect packing or MST-connected rooms) that outputs the *same* `RoomNode`/`RoomLink` structures the editor already produces. Because the bake pipeline (Tier 3–5) is complete, a generator only needs to *arrange* rooms — geometry resolution is free. That single addition flips the engine from "sandbox with procedural helpers" to "procedural level generator," and it composes with everything already built.

---

## Recommended next unlocks (short path)

1. **Unified world seed** — one root seed deriving cavern + graph + placement seeds (Tier 10). Cheap, and a prerequisite for reproducible generation.
2. **Room-graph generator v1** — random rect packing + MST connectivity → existing bake (Tier 11 rung 1). The keystone.
3. **Seed golden tests** — lock CA, room-graph bake, and maze helper output against known seeds before building generators on top.
4. **Poisson / min-distance placement** — replace uniform open-cell pick so content stops clumping (Tier 7).
5. **Second + third puzzle templates** — reuse the probe-before-commit pattern; grows the library (Tier 6).

> **On overlap:** when you build `levels.md` later, let it own *gameplay objectives, progression, and win/fail* — not geometry. This doc carves and arranges; a levels doc would say *what the player must do* in the arranged space, leaning on `AI.md` for solvability. Keep geometry here, goals there.
